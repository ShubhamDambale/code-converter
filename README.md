## Code Converter Functionality

The project includes a code converter feature that allows users to convert code snippets or files between various programming languages. This utility aims to assist developers in translating code from one language to another, simplifying the process of language migration or cross-platform development.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Language Support:** Supports conversion among a wide array of programming languages including but not limited to Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and more.
- **Snippet/File Conversion:** Allows conversion of both code snippets and entire code files.
- **Accuracy and Precision:** Strives to provide accurate and precise translations between programming languages.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Implements an easy-to-use interface for seamless code conversion.

### Implementation Details

The code conversion functionality within the project is powered by a language translation library (provide the name if applicable) or a custom-built translation engine. It utilizes a robust set of algorithms to ensure accurate transformation and mapping of syntax from one language to another.

The backend handling of these code translation requests is managed through dedicated endpoints within the Flask server, allowing for efficient processing and conversion. The frontend interface provides users with an intuitive platform to input their code snippets or upload code files for conversion between languages.

### How to Use the Code Converter

1. **Select Input Language:** Choose the source programming language for the code snippet or file.
2. **Choose Target Language:** Specify the desired programming language for conversion.
3. **Input Code Snippet or File:** Paste the code snippet or upload the file for translation.
4. **Get Translated Code:** Retrieve the translated code in the selected output language.
